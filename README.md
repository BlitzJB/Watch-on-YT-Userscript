# Watch-on-YT-Userscript
Userscript to insert watch on YT button onto our institute's class recordings page. 
YT video player >> Ecas

Script hooks into XHR requests made by the client and extracts the youtube video id. 
Then printing it into the console would have been fine, but there is such things called "asthetics" that some people talk about.

so it Inserts a nice button into the UI
